✅ Step-by-Step Flow for Account Creation & Family Data Feeding:
1. 📝 User Registration Flow:
Options at Login Screen:

Register as Elder

Register as Family Member

Registration Fields:
| Elder Registration | Family Member Registration |
|--|--|
| Name | Name |
| Age | Relation to Elder |
| Email / Phone | Email / Phone |
| Password | Password |
| Emergency Contacts | Elder's Unique Code (see below) |

Use Firebase Authentication for basic auth (Email/Phone/Google Login).

2. 🔗 Elder-Family Linking Flow:
a) Elder Registration (First Step):
Elder signs up.

On successful signup:

Backend generates a Unique Elder Code / QR Code (Example: E1234-ABCD).

b) Family Registration (Second Step):
Family member registers.

During registration (or later from settings):

They input the "Elder Unique Code" to link their account.

On successful input:

Backend adds family member userId to assignedFamilyIds of the elder.

Also saves elderId reference in the family member’s profile.

3. 🗂️ Adding Multiple Family Members:
Elder can share their Unique Elder Code with multiple family members.

Each family member, during signup, inputs the code and links to that elder.

Elder gets a notification:

“Ravi (Son) has requested to monitor your care profile. Approve? (Yes / No)”
(Optional feature for elder consent)

4. 🧑‍💻 Post Registration Data Feeding by Family:
Once a family account is created and linked to an elder:

Family members can:
✅ Set Medication Reminders
✅ Set Appointment Schedules
✅ View elder’s mood logs
✅ View location (if allowed)
✅ Send check-in prompts
✅ Start video calls
✅ Configure SOS emergency contacts
✅ Monitor dashboard statistics

Elder can:
✅ See scheduled reminders
✅ Respond to check-ins
✅ Trigger SOS
✅ Update daily mood

5. 🔐 Security & Privacy Considerations:
Elder should approve family link requests (Optional, but recommended for privacy).

Provide "Unlink Family" option for elders.

Provide data encryption for location, health, and contact details.

Store minimal elder data on device. Sync everything through backend with secure APIs.

6. 🎨 UI Flow Sample:
Screen	Description
Welcome	Login / Register
Registration Type	Select Elder or Family
Elder Registration	Fill basic info, submit
Elder Unique Code Generated	Displayed post-elder registration
Family Registration	Fill info + Elder Unique Code
Elder Approval (Optional)	Elder receives approval request
Dashboard	Elder Mode / Family Mode loaded based on user type

✅ Summary for AI Agent Backend Development Prompt (Account Creation & Family Link):
"Build Firebase backend (or .NET Core/Node.js API) to support two user types: Elder and Family.
Implement user registration with role selection, with elder users getting a unique link code.
Family users should be able to input this code to link to an elder.
Store family-elder relationships in Firestore (or DB), allowing multiple family members per elder.
Enable CRUD APIs for reminders, mood logs, SOS alerts, check-ins, and user profiles with real-time Firestore listeners or REST API endpoints.
Implement elder consent approval flow for added security."
